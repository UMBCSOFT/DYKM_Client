# Do You Know Me?

**Do You Know Me?** is a fun, friend-group focused, web-based multiplayer game built around the idea of figuring out how well you know your friends. 

Create a game, invite all your friends, choose the question pack you want to play with, and choose the number of rounds. Each round, all players are asked the same question and each must submit an answer. Afterwards, all of the players must guess who wrote each answer. For each question and answer pair you match correctly, you get a point.

Have fun!
